Dear Monaparty node runners,

Counterpary-server for Monaparty was upgraded to 9.5812.0.

This upgrade contains only an API refinement and no contract change.
So it is not urgent. 
Please upgrade it if you have a time.

`fednode rebuild` and `fednode upgrade` 

Note that this upgrade requires full DB reparse.
So it requires an hour or more to finish your node healthy.

Thank node runners a lot for supporting Monaparty.
