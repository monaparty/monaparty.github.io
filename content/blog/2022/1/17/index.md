Hello developers in the Monaparty world.

# What's "binarystore" ?

We started to study for adding a binary storage to Monaparty chain.
we'll provide a way to store your binaries (the recommended size limit is about 10kB).

# The road to "Monaparty Automation"

You will be enable to use this function just as a short storage.

In addition, it will be used in upcoming "Monaparty Automation".
Message-templates and Partyscript byte-codes will be stored in the binarystore.
This is one of the key component for the future Monaparty.

binarystore related specification will be defined XMPIP-0022.
Please check it if you are a dApps developer.

Happy Hacking.
