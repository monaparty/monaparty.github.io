Hello Monaparty folks,

We're happy to release new functionariry for the Monaparty eco-system.

We've published [a Helm chart for the high availability IPFS cluster](https://github.com/monaparty/helm-ipfs-cluster).

Currently it's on a "preview" state. But we hope it will work fine almost all envs.

The chart itself doesn't any pins to impotant content for Monaparty.
Some more hacks are required.
We're working to release a Monaparty integration such as [Countertable](https://github.com/monaparty/countertable).

Please feel free to send any requests for this new subproject via [GitHub](https://github.com/monaparty/helm-ipfs-cluster/discussions/).

Happy your party-time with Monaparty.
