Dear Monaparty funs,

We found critical issue by Trigger message on the testnet.
So we decided to postpone the activation for Trigger message on the mainnet (and also the testnet).
Asset metadata is based on Trigger message. So it is also postponed.

It will be re-activated on the next release train.

We aporogize to funs for confusing Monaparty chain.
We are going to kaizen our release process.
