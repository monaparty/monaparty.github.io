Hello, Monaparty guys.

We Monapaty Dev decided to enable new protocol features periodicaly.

It is called as "Release Train" on the software engineering.

The train departs on time and only those who are in time can board it.
Similarly, only features inplemented in time are activated.
We don't postpone the departure time.

The next train departs on the block 2323230 (mainnet), 1120000 (testnet).


Currently there are 2 protocol changes are onboarding.

* nondivisible_dividend_fix
* dont_credit_zero_dividend

Both of them are bug fixes for dividen. For more details please refer [CIP-23](https://github.com/CounterpartyXCP/cips/blob/master/cip-0023.md).

We plans some more new features for dApps developers and users.

Please wait for a while until departure.

Thanks,
