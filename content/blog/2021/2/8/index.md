Hello, Monaparty guys.

Some protocols on the Monaparty contract platform will be changed on the mainnet block 227000.
The current estimated time is Mar 10, 2021.

There are two changes on boarding.

# Details

## fee_revision_2021_1q

This change increase the fee cost for issuances.
Users must pay 100 times XMP asset for new asset than previous.

After enabled this change, fees are like this.

kind           | new fee (XMP)
---------------|---------
Named assets   | 50
Subassets      | 25
A-prefix assets| 0

The aim of this change is to support values of Monaparty assets.
And also increase rarity of the XMP asset.

## utf-8_codec_fixes

This is a bug fix.
After enabled this change, the message decoder works better in case broken UTF-8 string was applied.

# Next protocol changes?

The Monaaparty dev decided to postpone some protocol changes. Mainly Monaparty Automation related.

And we planning to add "True NFT issuance."

They will be applyed to nodes soon. (in 10 weeks or more.)

Enjoy Monaparty.

Thanks,
