Counterpary-server for Monaparty was upgraded to 9.5812.0.
This upgrade contains only an API refinement and no contract change. So it is not urgent. Please upgrade it if you have a time.
fednode rebuild and fednode upgrade
Note that this upgrade requires full DB reparse. So it requires an hour or more to finish your node healthy.
Thank node runners a lot for supporting Monaparty.</description></item><item><title>Counterblock updated to 1.4.2+mona001</title><link>https://monaparty.me/blog/2021/7/13/</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jul 2021 06:28:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://monaparty.me/blog/2021/7/13/</guid><description>Hello Monaparty fednode server admins,
