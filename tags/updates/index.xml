We&amp;rsquo;re happy to release new functionariry for the Monaparty eco-system.
We&amp;rsquo;ve published a Helm chart for the high availability IPFS cluster.
Currently it&amp;rsquo;s on a &amp;ldquo;preview&amp;rdquo; state. But we hope it will work fine almost all envs.
The chart itself doesn&amp;rsquo;t any pins to impotant content for Monaparty. Some more hacks are required. We&amp;rsquo;re working to release a Monaparty integration such as Countertable.
Please feel free to send any requests for this new subproject via GitHub.</description></item><item><title>indexd-server is updated to 0.0.2</title><link>https://monaparty.me/blog/2021/11/14/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://monaparty.me/blog/2021/11/14/</guid><description>Monaparty version of indexd-server was updated to 0.0.2.
